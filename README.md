# Get started

1.  If you don't have node installed or are using a version older than 8

    - **Mac:** `brew install node`
    - If you don't have brew installed you can run `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
    - **Windows:** `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

2.  Clone the repository
3.  In the project root folder
4.  Install yarn

    - `npm install -g yarn`
    - the node version is a dependency in the package.json file, so the correct version of node will be installed (if using node version 8 or higher)

5.  Install dependencies and start the application
    - yarn install
    - yarn start
